Lead is a potent neurotoxin that continues to endanger the health and wellbeing of communities across the greater Los Angeles area. Researchers have identified lead hazards present in soil and water sources at parks, schools and residential areas throughout the city, but a vast majority are in low-income Black and Latino communities. Lead in the environment comes from a variety of sources including drinking water, paint and soil. It can enter the body through inhalation or hand-to-mouth pathways. According to the CDC, there is no safe level of lead in blood, regardless of age group. However, children ages 0-3 and pregnant women absorb lead more easily than other demographic groups and are more susceptible to lead poisoning. Lead poisoning can result in serious learning and developmental issues, along with increased risk of hypertension. While the dangers of acute exposure to lead are well-studied, data on the effects of long-term lead exposure is limited. Removing lead hazards remains the most effective way to reduce the risk of lead exposure.
